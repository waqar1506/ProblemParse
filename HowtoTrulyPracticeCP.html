        <h2>How to truly practice competitive programming</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="bodycont">
        <p class="ktitle">📔 Solve a lot of problems is correct—but incomplete</p>
        <p class="kcontent">Solving many problems is necessary, but how and why you solve them matters just as much. Mindless repetition without reflection rarely leads to real improvement.</p>
        <p class="ktitle">📔 Organized weekly practice alone doesn’t build excellence</p>
        <p class="kcontent">Weekly contests or scheduled training sessions give structure, but they are not enough. If your entire practice depends on fixed sessions, progress will be slow and limited.</p>

        <p class="ktitle">📔 Weekly training can become an excuse</p>
        <p class="kcontent">Many people hide behind statements like “I practice every week” while ignoring the fact that they are not actually improving. Real progress requires more than attendance.</p>
        
        <p class="ktitle">📔 Strong programmers let CP live in their mind</p>
        <p class="kcontent">Top programmers don't just “practice CP”—they think about problems constantly, even outside contests. Algorithms become part of their natural thought process</p>

        <p class="ktitle">📔 Enjoyment is the real fuel</p>
        <p class="kcontent">If you don’t enjoy problem-solving and seeing yourself improve, you won’t last long. Passion creates consistency; forced discipline does not</p>

        <p class="ktitle">📔 Algorithmic thinking leaks into real life</p>
        <p class="kcontent">When CP truly clicks, you start noticing patterns, optimizations, and logical structures in everyday situations—not because you try, but because your brain adapts</p>

        <p class="ktitle">📔 Practice should be driven by desire, not schedules</p>
        <p class="kcontent">The best practice happens when you suddenly think “I want to solve something now.” These moments often lead to the deepest learning</p>

        <p class="ktitle">📔 Lack of urge means weak motivation</p>
        <p class="kcontent">If you never feel an inner push to practice and only rely on schedules, it’s worth asking whether you truly want to become better—or just like the idea of it</p>

        <p class="ktitle">📔 Weaknesses are opportunities, not threats</p>
        <p class="kcontent">Being bad at topics like combinatorics or DP is good news—it shows where growth is possible. Attack weaknesses directly instead of avoiding them</p>

                <p class="ktitle">📔 Only challenging problems make you grow</p>
        <p class="kcontent">If you never feel an inner push to practice and only rely on schedules, it’s worth asking whether you truly want to become better—or just like the idea of it</p>

                <p class="ktitle">📔 Any goal is valid if it pushes you</p>
        <p class="kcontent">Whether it’s solving all problems on a site, beating a friend, or finishing a contest—motivation is personal. What matters is that the challenge is real</p>

                        <p class="ktitle">📔 Extreme practice is fine when passion exists</p>
        <p class="kcontent">Doing back-to-back long contests or heavy practice sessions is healthy only when driven by excitement, not pressure or guilt</p>

                        <p class="ktitle">📔 Solved problems should stay in your head</p>
        <p class="kcontent">After solving a problem, think deeper:
            What if constraints changed? What if it were harder?
            This reflection builds long-term skill.</p>
                        <p class="ktitle">📔 Struggling for days is not failure</p>
        <p class="kcontent">Spending days stuck on a meaningful problem is normal. The satisfaction of finally solving it is one of the greatest rewards in CP</p>

        <p class="fm">Competitive programming is not something you improve at by following a strict timetable or attending a few weekly contests. Real growth happens when problem-solving becomes a natural part of how you think. You must genuinely enjoy the challenge, feel curious about harder problems, and want to push your limits without being forced. Organized practice, virtual contests, and team trainings are useful tools, but they should support your motivation, not replace it. The strongest programmers think about problems even after solving them, reflect deeply, and willingly struggle for days on meaningful tasks. If you truly want to get better, let competitive programming live in your mind, guide your curiosity, and drive you forward</p>
